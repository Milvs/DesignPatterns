# Java Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in Java. The project is structured based on creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

## Creational Patterns
- ðŸ“¦ **Factory method** [view](https://github.com/Milvs/DesignPatterns/tree/main/FactoryMethod)
- ðŸ“¦ **Abstract factory** [view]()
- ðŸ“¦ **Singleton** [view](https://github.com/Milvs/DesignPatterns/tree/main/SingletonPattern)

## Structural Patterns
- ðŸŽ² **Adapter** [view]()
- ðŸŽ² **Composite** [view]()
- ðŸŽ² **Decorator** [view](https://github.com/Milvs/DesignPatterns/tree/main/DecoratorPattern)
- ðŸŽ² **Facade** [view]()
- ðŸŽ² **Proxy** [view]()

## Behavioral Patterns
- âš™ **Chain of responsibility** [view]()
- âš™ **Command** [view](https://github.com/Milvs/DesignPatterns/tree/main/CommandPattern)
- âš™ **Iterator** [view]()
- âš™ **Observer** [view]()
- âš™ **Strategy** [view]()
- âš™ **Visitor** [view]()

## Burger Restaurant exercise

  A young man who successfully completed a cooking course decided to open a small burger restaurant. Since he didn't have a large capital, he hired only one employee - a cashier.
  There were only the two of them in the restaurant. The chef had access to the kitchen, where he could prepare three types of burgers - Royal, Classic, and Vegetarian.
  The workflow proceeded as follows: The cashier took the order and told the chef what type of burger to prepare. The chef then prepared the corresponding burger in the kitchen.
  Different sauces could be added to the finished burger - garlic sauce or ketchup.

  Use the following design patterns:<br>
  - Restaurant - Singleton<br>
  - Cashier and Chef - Command<br>
  - Kitchen and Burgers - Factory<br>
  - Adding sauces to burgers - Decorator
